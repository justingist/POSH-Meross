# POSH-Meross
Powershell Tools for Meross Home Automation


I have just begun creating this code as of March 2nd 2020... commandlets will begin to appear in the next few days.

Authentication and listing of devices works in my initial rough code, but I need to enhance to collect additional information, such as power consumption. 

Keep an eye here!
